Dual-task Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Visual Working Memory (VWM) Experiment

Calibration Instructions
========================

Use StartMOTMCS to conduct MOT calibration for each participant. The only 
required argument is subject_name. The name can only contain letters, numbers, 
or underscores. E.g.:

    StartMOTMCS('mark_l')

The calibration will be conducted in 2 stages each composed of 50 trials. In the
first stage the tested speeds will be 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. In the second stage
the speeds will be more narrowly centred around the 75% correct threshold 
estimated from the results of the first stage. E.g., if performance is estimated
to be 75% correct at a speed of 10, the speeds for the second stage will be
8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. 

After the second stage a speed will be suggested based on the results of both
stages. That speed should result in performance around 70% correct.

It is possible that the first attempt at calibration will be unclear. After the 
first stage is complete you will see the suggested speed as well as a graph of
performance for each speed tested. Performance should decrease with increasing
speed. If this is not the case it might be best to repeat the calibration with 
different parameters. 
Do this using MOT_MCS(subject_name, num_trials, base_speed, speed_inc). E.g.,

    MOT_MCS('mark_l', 50, 5, 2)

This will test participant mark_l on 50 trials evenly distributed over speeds
1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. It will then display the estimated 75% threshold speed and a
graph of performance for each speed.
